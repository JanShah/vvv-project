				<h4>Travelling Clothes about 1250AD</h4>
				<p>
					I found this info about Tunics today, an interesting read and coinciding with the arrival of our latest range of 
					<a href='products.html#tunics'>mens tunics</a>
					<q>
						By 1250 men’s and women’s tunics were cut with a wide upper sleeve. Most men, except the elderly, preferred tunics short. Cloaks were usually held by a cord at the shoulder. A variety of loose over-gowns were also popular, and these had sleeves with two openings, allowing them to hang loosely like the university gowns based on them and still seen today.

				<h4>The British Curry</h4>
				<p>
					For all the foodies out there, some interesting info about our long and interesting relationship with Curries :) 
					<q>
						If Britain taught India how to play cricket, India perhaps returned the favour by teaching the British how to enjoy a hot Indian curry. By the 18th century, East India Company men (popularly called ‘nabobs’, an English corruption of the Indian word ‘nawab’ meaning governors or viceroys) returning home wanted to recreate a slice of their time spent in India. Those who couldn’t afford to bring back their Indian cooks satisfied their appetite at coffee houses. As early as 1733, curry was served in the Norris Street Coffee House in Haymarket. By 1784, curry and rice had become specialties in some popular restaurants in the area around London’s Piccadilly.

			<h4>An introduction, of sorts.  <abbr title="Valiant's Vintage Vestures">VVV</abbr></h4>
			<p><q>Voilà! In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran, cast vicariously as both victim and villain by the vicissitudes of Fate. This visage, no mere veneer of vanity, is a vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished. However, this valorous visitation of a by-gone vexation, stands vivified and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin vanguarding vice and vouchsafing the violently vicious and voracious violation of volition...! </q><cite>V for Vendetta</cite></p>
